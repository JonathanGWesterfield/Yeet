# Yeet Delivery
It's really called Beem but I named the repo Yeet because of the following scenario:

    Friend: "Dang I left my poker set at home!"
    Me: "Why don't you just yeet it over here?"
    Friend: "I'll slap you."
    Me: "I mean use this app to have it shipped here. It's literally called Yeet."
    Friend: "That makes me viscerally angry but thats a good idea."
    Me: "Yeet"

# About
This is my implementation of the backend of a crowd-sourced delivery system. While I would like to actaully implement the whole thing, I simply don't have time. However, I really wanted to play with Apach Kafka so I decided I would just implement the backend.
